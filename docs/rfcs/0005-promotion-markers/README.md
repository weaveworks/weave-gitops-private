## Summary

<!--
One paragraph explanation of the proposed feature or enhancement.
-->

Provide a mechanism by which Pipelines can target the correct manifest to effect a promotion, and make the appropriate change, when using the pull-request strategy.

## Motivation

<!--
This section is for explicitly listing the motivation, goals, and non-goals of
this RFC. Describe why the change is important and the benefits to users.
-->

[RFC 0003](../0003-pipelines-promotion) describes the general promotion flow and defines the possibility for several distinct promotion strategies to be implemented. One of these promotion strategies further described in [this document of the same RFC](0003-pipelines-promotion/execute-promotion.md#create-a-pr) is one that creates a PR for promoting an app version to the next environment. For this to work the implementation will need to determine which field in which YAML manifest file in the repository contains the app version. One such approach is described herein.

### Goals

<!--
List the specific goals of this RFC. What is it trying to achieve? How will we
know that this has succeeded?
-->

- Define a means for discovering a specific field in one or more YAML files located in a particular directory hierarchy.
- Define a way to update that field in-place in all of the relevant files.

## Proposal

<!--
This is where we get down to the specifics of what the proposal actually is.
This should have enough detail that reviewers can understand exactly what
you're proposing, but should not include things like API designs or
implementation.

If the RFC goal is to document best practices,
then this section can be replaced with the the actual documentation.

Similar to what Flux offers with [image update automations](https://fluxcd.io/flux/guides/image-update/#configure-image-update-for-custom-resources) this RFC proposes to use well-formatted YAML comments for discovering and updating fields pertaining to a certain Pipeline's application. Here is an example of such a comment:

```yaml
apiVersion: kustomize.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v1beta2
kind: Kustomization
spec:
  postBuild:
    substitute:
      podinfoVersion: 6.2.0 # {"$promotion": "default:podinfo:prod"}
[...]
```

This comment is a JSON object comprised of the following parts:

- The key `$promotion` designates it as pertaining to pipeline promotions.
- The value `default:podinfo:prod` refers to the environment called "prod" in the Pipeline resource named "podinfo" in the Kubernetes Namespace "default".

An implementation of this RFC has the following inputs and outputs:

### Inputs

- A Pipeline that a particular promotion is supposed to represent
- An environment name. This can either be the target environment name ("prod" in the example above) or an environment preceeding the target environment (e.g. "dev"). In the latter case the implementation would have to fetch the Pipeline from the Kubernetes API and determine the target environment by itself.
- A field value that is used to update the field targeted by the given promotion. This can be a Helm chart version, a Git commit SHA, an image tag or any other value that makes sense in the given user scenario.

### Outputs

Given the inputs above an implementation is able to precisely determine which marker comment it is supposed to discover and with which value it shall update the targeted YAML field. The output of this operation is one or more modified YAML files.

### Drawbacks to the proposed approach

- Requires update to application manifests to know about pipelines.
- Comments are often stripped by tooling
  - This includes our own Templates capability currently. There is a potential enhancement to solve this but it has its own drawbacks beyond cost of implementation.

### Alternatives

<!--
List plausible alternatives to the proposal and explain why the proposal is superior.

This is a good place to incorporate suggestions made during discussion of the RFC.
-->

This RFC is a retroactive definition of what has been implemented in pipeline-controller. No alternatives were considered for this initial delivery, but are recorded here for potential future iteration. The initial proposed approach was deemed viable primarily given its similar use within Flux. Coupled with the desire within Weave GitOps to both build natively on top of Flux, and to optimise for velocity and iteration based on customer feedback.

#### Scenarios

**Base Scenario**

As to illustrate a couple of potential alternatives, the following base scenario will be used. 

There is a pipeline definition like the following.

```yaml
apiVersion: pipelines.weave.works/v1alpha1
kind: Pipeline
metadata:
  name: podinfo-01
  namespace: flux-system
spec:
  appRef:
    apiVersion: helm.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v2beta1
    kind: HelmRelease
    name: podinfo
  environments:
    - name: dev
      targets:
        - namespace: podinfo-01-dev
          clusterRef:
            kind: GitopsCluster
            name: dev
            namespace: flux-system
    - name: prod
      targets:
        - namespace: podinfo-01-prod
          clusterRef:
            kind: GitopsCluster
            name: prod
            namespace: default
  promotion:
    pull-request:
      url: https://github.com/weaveworks/weave-gitops-clusters
      secretRef:
        name: promotion-credentials
```
Helm releases manifests exists like 

```yaml
apiVersion: helm.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v2beta1
kind: HelmRelease
metadata:
  name: podinfo
spec:
  interval: 5m
  chart:
    spec:
      chart: podinfo
      version: "6.0.1"
      sourceRef:
        kind: HelmRepository
        name: podinfo
      interval: 1m
```

#### Leverage to custom layout directory

This alternative solves the base scenario by allowing the pipeline owner to define based 
on pipeline properties the layout of repo to use the discovery. Any of the entities within the `pipeline` spec
coudl be referenced for discovery. 

For example using [flux](https://fluxcd.io/flux/guides/repository-structure) ways of organise repo. A monorepo 
could be navigated with the following configuration: 

```yaml
promotion:
    pull-request:
      url: https://github.com/weaveworks/weave-gitops-clusters
      match: "path(apps/{environment.name}/{application.name})"
      secretRef:
        name: promotion-credentials
```

1. Discover the helm release manifest to promote: it will use `spec.promotion.pull-request.match` 
to determine the path for manifest to promote.
2. Discover the field to promote: not required as we could resolve it via the schema `spec.chart.spec.version`.

##### Evaluation

__Pros__

- Manifests discovery is an explicit strategy defined within pipeline boundaries (manifest and configuration repo).  
- Loosely couple solution 
  - Pipeline behaviours like promotions don't impose restrictions in application manifests
  - Application manifests does not know about pipelines.

__Cons__

- Same discovery mechanism applies to any application in any deployment target within any environment so there 
is a need for consistency.
- It is unlikely that a single directory-structure strategy would cover all customer scenarios. For example version set by 
variable and using [variable substiution](https://fluxcd.io/flux/components/kustomize/kustomization/#variable-substitution). It would
require to either support a set of strategies or to don't support some scenarios.


#### Leverage labels or annotations 

This alternative tries to address the same problem using a solution based on kubernetes annotations.
Similar to [argocd resource tracking](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user-guide/resource_tracking/#resource-tracking)

An example could be
```yaml
promotion:
    pull-request:
      url: https://github.com/weaveworks/weave-gitops-clusters
      match: "labels(app.kubernetes.io/environment=environment, annotherLabel)"
      match: "annotations(app.kubernetes.io/environment=environment, anotherAnnotation)"
      secretRef:
        name: promotion-credentials
```
With the resource annotated like the following
```yaml
apiVersion: helm.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v2beta1
kind: HelmRelease
metadata:
  name: podinfo
  annotations:
    app.kubernetes.io/environment: "dev"
spec:
  interval: 5m
  chart:
    spec:
      chart: podinfo
      version: "6.0.1"
      sourceRef:
        kind: HelmRepository
        name: podinfo
      interval: 1m
```

1. Discover the helm release manifest to promote: it will use `spec.promotion.pull-request.match` to determine 
 the resources matching by label or annotation.
2. Discover the field to promote: not required as we could resolve it via the schema `spec.chart.spec.version`.

##### Evaluation

__Pros__

- Resolution leverages a kubernetes-native metadata solution based on labels or annotations so well understood 
by kubernetes users and supported by standard tooling.

__Cons__

- Application manifests does need to know about pipelines.
- Resolution logic split between pipeline and application manifests.
