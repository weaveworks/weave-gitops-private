# Product Architecture
This proposal aims to provide a set of recommendations that we could apply to weave gitops architecture to address 
some current issues, dependencies and impediments. 

## Glossary 

- Gitops OSS: weave gitops open source
- Gitops Enterprise: weave gitops open source

## Problem statement

We have seen across our organisation the following 

Looking internally

- As weave gitops developer, I want to deliver gitops oss or enterprise capabilities, however i find difficult to deliver due to handoffs
required during the delivery lifecycle.
- As weave gitops developer, I want to reuse as much code as possible to reduce lead time for bringing a change while keeping
experience between products.
- As weave gitops developer, deliverying expereinces to both opensource and enterprise i want to have a seamlessly experience
while deliverying to both products to reduce effort.  

Looking externally 


- As weave gitops user, I would like to have more capabilities to gitops opensource being delivered for unit of time.
- As weave gitops oss user, I want a seamless experience in the journey of transitions to enterprise 


As summary we would like to have an architecture that enables for a fast flow of chanages. This proposal 
provides context on why we have some of the issues and provides a set of recommendations to address and track these issues.
