# 16. secrets management for profiles from private helm repositories

## Status

Proposed

## Context
As part of Weave GitOps Enterprise, Timberwolf is working on delivering [Secrets Management](https://www.notion.so/weaveworks/Secrets-Management-f6add2cba4be4faa8bbad1276fb0455e).
One of the use cases to enable by this initiative is to be able to use [weave gitops profiles](https://docs.gitops.weave.works/docs/cluster-management/profiles/)
from [private helm repositories](https://fluxcd.io/flux/guides/helmreleases/#helm-repository-authentication-with-credentials).

This is a common scenario for enterprises willing to use profiles but having to use an off-road solution or non-long
term solution for enterprise like using public helm repositories. 

This ADR states the different alternatives in the solution space and selects the ones that enable
enterprises using the feature securely.
