# 13. API deprecation

## Status

Proposed

## Context

Weave gitops leverages different api layers within the product. Therefore, as part of the natural evolution of the 
product, the apis are expected to evolve so a management of its lifecycle is required. As part of this lifecycle, 
a strategy for deprecation is required in place to setup a sensible contract that allow 

- developer to have a mechanism to evolve their apis
- customers to have stability enough to adopt these changes

This ADR defines an initial api deprecation strategy for weave gitops based on kubernetes api deprecation policy 

https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/deprecation-policy/


## Decision




TBA
